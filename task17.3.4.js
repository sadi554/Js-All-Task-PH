task 4:

const a = isNaN("11"); 

false --> The isNaN function checks whether a value is NaN (Not-a-Number).
    "11" is a string, but when passed to isNaN, JavaScript tries to convert it to a number.
    Since "11" can be successfully converted to the number 11, isNaN("11") evaluates to false.]

const a = isNaN(2 - 10); 

false[2 - 10 results in -8, which is a valid number.
    isNaN(-8) checks whether -8 is NaN.
    Since -8 is a valid number, isNaN(-8) evaluates to false.]
